# city-cast

## Description
   I used JavaScript to create a Weather Dashboard that uses the Openweather API to find specific weather data for certain cities using coordinates. I created a search function to find specific towns and a history tab to see and interact with past searches. Searching for a city presents you with Temperature, Wind Speed, Humidity and UV%. There are also cards displaying the forecast for the next 5 days.
